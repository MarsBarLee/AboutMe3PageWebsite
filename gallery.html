    <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
    <p>Made in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator
        <br>
        I worked with fellow student leaders to advertise their events, with each event having over 200 posters across campus and social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.
        I've also organized many of these events as well.</p>

                <h3>Used by commercial artists</h3>
                <br>
                <p>This loud, fun poster was not only displayed on campus, but also used by the featured local drag queens on their own social media.</p>

                <h3>Introducing foreign ideas in approachable way</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Since Paganism is unknown to many people, I focused on making accesible and fun events that both Pagans and non-Pagans could enjoy. This poster emphasizes the bright and cozy craft instead of anything too heavy.</p>

                <h3>Cross-cultural design</h3>
                <br>
                <p>While this design is striking, it also speaks a visual language that many Asian students would instantly understand. The red and yellow color scheme and Chinese character represents both good luck and the holiday.
